# Spectral Deconvolution via Least-Squares Fitting

This is a Python script for performing spectral deconvolution using non-negative least-squares optimization. It is handy in analytical chemistry, bioengineering, or spectroscopy where complex spectra must be broken down into known pure components.
Carotenoids pure spectra I used for my project were originally published by:

# Lesley A Clementson, Bozena Wojtasiewicz. Dataset on the absorption characteristics of extracted phytoplankton pigments. Data Brief. 2019 Mar 29;24:103875. doi: 10.1016/j.dib.2019.103875

You can generate your pure spectra for similar applications as well or use the data published in that paper.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Reads experimental and pure component spectra from CSV files
- Applies least-squares fitting with non-negativity constraints
- Outputs:
  - Optimized component coefficients for each sample
  - Reconstructed spectra
  - Goodness-of-fit metrics (SSE, RSEM)
  - Partial contributions of each component
- Ready-to-use with plotting capabilities

## ðŸ§ª Input Files

- `YOUR_EXPERIMENTAL_dATA.csv`: Experimental spectra file with a column `wavelength` and columns for each sample.
- `PURE_SPECTRUM_REFERENCE.csv`: Pure spectra file with a column `wavelength` and columns for each reference component.

## ðŸ“¤ Output Files

- `coefficients_grg.csv`: Component contribution coefficients per sample.
- `reconstructed_spectra_grg.csv`: Reconstructed spectra using the coefficients.
- `fit_statistics_grg.csv`: Goodness-of-fit statistics.
- `combined_partial_contributions_optimized.csv`: Spectral contributions from each component.

## ðŸš€ Usage

Just run the script with Python:

```bash
python Spectral_Deconvolution.py
```

Make sure the input files (`YOUR_EXPERIMENTAL_dATA.csv` and `PURE_SPECTRUM_REFERENCE.csv`) are in the same directory.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
